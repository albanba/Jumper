# Jumper
Experience the urge to stop the fall! <i>Jumper</i> gives you only a few chances to guess the secret  
password before your parachute disappears. The rules are simple. Enter letters that might fit in the secret word.  
if the guess is correct, the letter is revealed. If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on your parachute.
If the puzzle is solved you are saved.
If you have no more parachute left, well... you get the picture.
